EXPLANATION OF THURGAU ANALYSIS SCRIPTS
-----------------------------------------



01_microcensus_population_filter.py
-----------------------------------------

1. Load and Process Microcensus Data
	With execute_person(path) we:
		Loads zielpersonen.csv (individuals)
		Renames and re-codes key variables:
			age, sex, marital_status, employed, etc.
			Access to transport modes (e.g., car_availability, driving_license)
			Subscriptions (GA, Halbtax, etc.)
			Weekend flag and education level
			Creates age classes and fixes marital status for young individuals
		Returns a cleaned DataFrame of individuals
		
	🏘With execute_household(path) we:
		Loads haushalte.csv (households)
		Renames and calculates:
			Household size, cars, bikes, income
			Converts coordinates from CH1903 to LV95 (CH1903+)
			Classifies cars, bikes, household size
			Infers spatial region (sp_region)
		Returns a cleaned DataFrame of households

2. Merge Person + Household Data from 2 to one Data Frame
	Merges individuals with their household info on person_id
	Saves the full merged population to all_population.csv

IMPORTANT
In Microcensus no children below 6 year old
Number of persons 57090 inside zielpersonen.csv and haushalte.csv, also the same in the population.csv data frame.

IN --> microzensus/zielpersonen.csv , microzensus/haushalte.csv

OUT --> microzensus/all_population.csv


02_microcensus_trips_filter.py
-----------------------------------------
Purpose: Prepare and filter microcensus trips and stages for further simulation, focusing on trips within a target area.

wege.csv 193.880 rows (trips) -- Swiss trips for 57k
etappen.csv 279.173 (legs)


	1. Load Microcensus Data
		Load trips (wege.csv) and stages (etappen.csv) from the microcensus data folder.
		Keep only essential columns like trip modes, purposes, coordinates, distances, etc.

	2. Recode Transport Modes
		Assign simplified transport modes based on wmittel codes (e.g., car, pt, bike, walk, unknown).
		Create a mode_detailed variable for more detailed distinctions (e.g., taxi, plane).

	3. Identify Car Passenger Trips
		Identify if a person was a passenger (stage with f51300 == 8).
		Label these trips accordingly as "car_passenger".

	4. Recode Trip Purposes
		Simplify the trip purposes (e.g., work, education, shop, leisure, home, other).
		If the return purpose (wzweck2) is given, reassign trip as returning "home".

	5. Adjust Times and IDs
		Convert departure and arrival times from minutes to seconds.
		Add person_id and trip_id fields.

	6. Transform Coordinates: 	Convert origin, destination, and home coordinates from CH1903 to CH1903+ CRS using pyproj.

	7. Compute Crowfly Distances
		Calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between trip origins and destinations.

	8. Calculate Activity Durations
		For each activity, estimate the duration as the difference between arrival and next trip’s departure time.

	9. Filter Individuals with not reliable data
		Remove persons who have:
			Trips with "unknown" mode.
			Trips that do not end at home.
			Trips that do not start from home.

	10. Add Parking Costs (???)
		Merge parking cost information from the stages dataset (f51330).
		Set missing parking costs to 0.

	11. Adjust Network Distance
		Convert reported distances to meters.

	12. Filter Based on Shapefile (Target Area)
		Filter trips:
			Trips entirely inside the area (origin AND destination inside).
			Trips partially inside (origin OR destination inside).
			Save both filtered datasets separately.

	13. Generate Activity Chains
		For each person, generate a simple chain of activity purposes (e.g., H-W-H-S-H).

	14. Filter Population Files
		Read all_population.csv 
		Create and save:
			Individuals whose trips start and end inside.
			Individuals with at least one trip inside.
			Trips associated with these individuals.

	15. Visualizations
		Plot and save:
			Mode share (total counts and percentages).
			Departure and arrival times throughout the day.
			Trip purposes (total counts and percentages).
			Activity chain distributions.

	Destination (end_x, end_y)

	Add these as new columns to output_trips_sim.

5. Coordinate Conversion
	Ensure that trip coordinate columns (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y) are floats for correct spatial operations.

6. Create Origin and Destination GeoSeries
	Convert origins and destinations into GeoSeries using the loaded shapefile CRS (Coordinate Reference System).

7. Spatial Filtering
	Filter trips:
		O and D inside: Both origin and destination inside the polygon.
		O or D inside: Either origin or destination inside the polygon.
		Save these filtered trip datasets as CSV files.

8. Identify Population Subsets
	Identify persons who have trips both origin and destination inside (unique_ids).
	Identify persons who have trips at least origin or destination inside.

9. Load Simulation Population Plans
	Load MATSim population plans (output_plans.xml.gz) using matsim.plan_reader_dataframe().
	WE CHECKED output_plans.persons and output_persons and they are both 398.245 of which 22999 are trucks

10. Filter and Save Population Subsets
	Save population files:
		Population with trips inside both origin and destination.
		Population with trips inside either origin or destination.
		Save these filtered populations as separate CSV files.

IN --> output_trips.csv , output_persons.csv.gz

(Example: a clean script description or README)


09_CSVs_in_a_column.py
-----------------------------------------
2. Load configuration
Reads configuration parameters like:

data_path, simulation_zone_name, scenario, sim_output_folder, etc.

4. Load and process data
For each file in the list:

If the file exists:

Reads the file into a pandas DataFrame.

Iterates through all columns and rows.

For each item:

Identifies what the value represents (e.g., "% Distance Bike Mic weighted", "% Trips Car Sim").

Assigns a proper label (title) depending on the file and column name.

Appends each labeled value into a list (consolidated_data).

5. Create and save a single CSV
If there is data collected:

Saves the result as modalSplitCalibration.csv in the mode_share_directory.

If no data is found:

Prints a message.

🧠 Short version:
This script consolidates results from multiple mode share comparison CSV files into a single organized CSV (modalSplitCalibration.csv) that contains all key indicators sorted and ready for further calibration or reporting.

Would you also like me to give you a suggested title and description you can paste at the top of the script to make it even clearer? 🚀
