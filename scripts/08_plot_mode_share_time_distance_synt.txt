-----------------------------------------
IN -->:
	Microcensus trips: trips_mic.csv
	Synthetic trips: travel_time_distance_mode_synt.csv
	Simulation trips: travel_time_distance_mode_sim.csv

Clean datasets:
	Remove modes like "truck" and "outside."
	Standardize mode names (capitalize, remove underscores).
	Convert travel times to seconds.

Compute Mode Share by Distance
	Microcensus:
		Total distance
		Distance weighted by household weight

	Synthetic and Simulation:
		Compute total distance.

	For each: Calculate the percentage share per transportation mode.

Plot Mode Share by Distance
	Create a grouped bar plot comparing the distance mode shares between:
		Microcensus (weighted)
		Microcensus (unweighted)
		Synthetic population
		Simulation output

Save the plot as a high-resolution image (Mode_share_by_Distance.png).

5. Compute Mode Share by Travel Time
Microcensus:

Compute for Synthetic and Simulation:
	Total travel time
	Travel time weighted by household weight
	For each: Calculate the percentage share per transportation mode.
